# TERMINOLOGY FOR BASIC INSTALL OF DSOI-SPEC

| Name                  | Description                                                                                    | Example                                                | Scope         | Mapping                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Cluster`             | A cluster consists of different types of nodes                                              | Apache Druid, Presto                                   | Singular Entity | -                                         |
| `Node`                | A cluster can have multiple nodes of the same `nodeType` or different `nodeType`               | Druid Cluster consists of multiple druid broker, A Presto Cluster consists of single coordinator | Singular Entity | `map[string]NodeSpec` ie one to many      |
| `NodeType`            | A `nodeType` defines the type of the node                                                      | `DruidBrokerAz1` has `nodeType` `broker`, and `PrestoWorkerAz2` has `nodeType` `worker`        | Node Scoped   | one to one ie each node has a `nodeType` |
| `K8sConfigGroups` | A node k8s config group consists of k8s specific configuration. Each Node is mapped to a node config group | `DruidBrokerAz1` is mapped to `high-mem` node config group and `DruidBrokerAz2` is mapped to `low-mem` node config group | Node Scope    | `map[string]nodeK8sConfigGroupSpec` ie Mapping of node config group to a node is one to many. |
| `AppConfigGroups`     | An appConfigGroup consists of app specific configuration                                      | `runtime.properties`, `log4j.xml`                     | Node and Cluster Scoped | `map[string]appK8sConfigGroupSpec` Mapping of an app group to node is one to many. |
| `DeploymentOrder`               | An order defines the order of execution of installation and upgrade for a `nodeType`           | Deploy druid nodes in order of broker > controller > historlcals > coordinator and router         | Cluster       | one to one for each `nodeType`          |
| `External`            | `External` consists of configurations of external dependency                                  | zookeeper, metadata stores, deepstroage               | Cluster       | `map[string]externalSpec` ie one `externalSpec` for one cluster |
