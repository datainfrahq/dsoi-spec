# Distributed Systems Operator Interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Distributed System Operator Interface is a specification for building kubernetes operator's for distributed systems. The spec defines standard practices which can help define custom resources. The spec defines most common deployments patterns in order to deploy and maintain heterogenous distributed system clusters. The DSOI spec is not static and expects to evolve. Not bound to any specific application. DSOI spec consists of kubernetes native CRD's and spec's. The goal is not to re-introduce any new concepts but to encapsulate existing spec in a single structured spec.
